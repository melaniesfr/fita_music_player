## Instructions to Build and Deploy The App
### Build an App Bundle
From the command line:
1. Enter `cd fita_music_player`.
2. Run `flutter build appbundle`.

The release bundle is created at `fita_music_player/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab`.

### Build an APK
From the command line:
1. Enter `cd fita_music_player`.
2. Run `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`.
   - (The flutter build command defaults to `--release`)

This command results in three APK files:
- `fita_music_player/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`
- `fita_music_player/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
- `fita_music_player/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-x86_64-release.apk`

Removing the `--split-per-abi` flag results in a fat APK that contains code compiled for *all* the target ABIs. Such APKs are larger in size than their split counterparts, causing the user to download native binaries that are not applicable to their deviceâ€™s architecture.

### Install an APK on a Device
From the command line:
1. Connect Android device to the computer with a USB cable.
2. Enter `cd fita_music_player`.
3. Run `flutter install`.

### Deploy The App
1. Create a developer account.
2. Update the app name.
3. Generate a keystore.
4. Move the key file to the project.
5. Create a `key.properties` file.
6. Updating `build.gradle`.
7. Build the app.
8. Deploy the app.
   - To deploy the application we need to create a new app at Google Play Console.
   - Go to "Internal testing", create a new release, upload the .aab file, and click "Save".
   - Add testers to the "Internal testing" release, creating an email list, andn click "Save changes".
9. Updating the app.
10. Backup there keystore.

### Ready Apps
But, I have prepared the app that is ready to install on your android device. You can directly install the application located in the folder:
> fita_music_player/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
